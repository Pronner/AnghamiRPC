# ðŸŽ¶ AnghamiRPC
The Anghami Music App rich presence for Discord. This doesn't exist, so I decided to make it.\
However, this may crash at certain times for no reason. So, I recommend that you run **Visual Studio** and use the RPC from there instead.

If you encounter an issue, you can report it to the [**__issues__**](https://github.com/Pronner/AnghamiRPC/issues) page, and I may or may not fix it.

### Compatibility
This is compatible on **Windows, Mac Linux**. Enjoy.
